```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```




```{r}
#Creating make n model data frame
#reading excel file
m_m <- readxl::read_excel('.\\DATA\\make_n_model\\mmAll.xlsx')
#demo tag
nrow(m_m)

# m_m <- full_join(m_m13, m_m14)
# paste(colnames(m_m13), " = ", colnames(m_m18))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
